# Research Creation Course CART 410

Meme Aesthetics is a research project, exploring the aesthetic queues of memes from politically left- and right-oriented forums.

The project was created in a team of 3 within the framework of an arts-based research course. My 2 teammates used a GAN model to 
generate images based on a database of memes originating politically left- and right-oriented forums. My part was to create the 
website with CSS, HTML and JavaScript, to showcase the final computer-generated images in form of a guessing game. Once the user 
guesses whether the image grit is based on left- or right-wing oriented memes, the correct answer is displayed. Additionally, the 
background gradient of the website changes to represent the colors of the Canadian liberal or conservative party in order to 
indicate the political direction of the underlying data set.

## Project Structure

The project code is very simplistic and consists of an index.html, stylesheet and simple script. The script will generate a random 
number and load an image to the website.
